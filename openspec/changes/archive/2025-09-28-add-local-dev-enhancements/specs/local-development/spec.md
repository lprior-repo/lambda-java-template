- **AND** maintain identical AWS service configurations between environments
- **AND** test against real AWS services with production-like data volumes

### Requirement: Developer Workflow Automation
The system SHALL provide streamlined Task-based commands for common development patterns.

#### Scenario: Ephemeral Environment Commands
- **WHEN** starting development work
- **THEN** provide `task ephemeral:start` command for creating and deploying to ephemeral environment
- **AND** provide `task ephemeral:debug` command for debugging against live AWS Lambda
- **AND** provide `task ephemeral:destroy` command for cleaning up environments

#### Scenario: Feature Flag Management Commands
- **WHEN** managing feature flags
- **THEN** provide `task flags:deploy` command for deploying feature flag configurations to ephemeral environment
- **AND** provide `task flags:list` command for viewing current feature flag states in live environment
- **AND** provide `task flags:toggle` command for quick feature flag changes in AppConfig

#### Scenario: Live Debugging Workflow Commands
- **WHEN** debugging applications in AWS
- **THEN** provide commands for deploying debug-enabled Lambda functions
- **AND** provide commands for establishing IDE connection to live Lambda
- **AND** provide commands for monitoring debug sessions and log tailing

### Requirement: Spring Boot 3 Native with AOT Compilation
The system SHALL use Spring Boot Native with Ahead-of-Time compilation to eliminate Lambda cold start penalties while providing excellent development experience.

#### Scenario: AOT Native Compilation for Production
- **WHEN** building for production deployment
- **THEN** use Spring Boot Native with GraalVM AOT compilation to create native executables
- **AND** eliminate JVM startup time and reduce Lambda cold start to sub-100ms
- **AND** compile all Spring Boot features and dependencies ahead-of-time, not dynamically

#### Scenario: Development Mode with DevTools
- **WHEN** running in development mode
- **THEN** use Spring Boot 3 with DevTools for hot reload during development
- **AND** provide rapid feedback loops while maintaining native compilation target
- **AND** enable Spring Boot actuator endpoints for development insights

#### Scenario: Native Image Optimization
