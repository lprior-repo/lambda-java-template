- [ ] 2.7 Add Task commands for switching between JVM development and native production modes

## 3. AWS AppConfig Infrastructure
- [ ] 3.1 Create terraform/appconfig.tf with application and environment resources

- [ ] 3.3 Create deployment strategies for gradual feature rollouts
- [ ] 3.4 Add IAM permissions for Lambda functions to access AppConfig
- [ ] 3.5 Add AppConfig outputs to terraform/outputs.tf

## 4. Spring Boot Native Feature Flag Integration
- [ ] 4.1 Create Spring Boot auto-configuration for AWS AppConfig with native compilation support
- [ ] 4.2 Implement AppConfig client as Spring Boot starter optimized for AOT compilation
- [ ] 4.3 Add Spring conditional beans based on feature flags (@ConditionalOnProperty) with native hints
- [ ] 4.4 Create Spring Boot configuration properties for feature flags with AOT metadata
- [ ] 4.5 Add circuit breaker pattern using Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker (native compatible)
- [ ] 4.6 Ensure all feature flag code compiles correctly with AOT and produces no runtime reflection
- [ ] 4.7 Integrate feature flags with Spring Boot profiles and externalized configuration

## 5. Live AWS Lambda Debugging
- [ ] 5.1 Create Lambda debugging layer with Java debug agent
- [ ] 5.2 Implement debug tunnel connection mechanism (WebSocket/SSH)
- [ ] 5.3 Add IDE configuration examples (IntelliJ, VSCode) for remote debugging
- [ ] 5.4 Implement debugging Task commands for live Lambda debugging
- [ ] 5.5 Create live debugging troubleshooting guide and documentation

## 6. Task Workflow Integration
- [ ] 6.1 Add `task ephemeral:start` for ephemeral environment creation and deployment
- [ ] 6.2 Add `task ephemeral:debug` for live Lambda debugging
- [ ] 6.3 Add `task ephemeral:destroy` for environment cleanup
- [ ] 6.4 Add `task flags:deploy` for feature flag deployment to ephemeral environment
- [ ] 6.5 Add `task flags:list` for viewing current feature flag states in live environment

## 7. Spring Boot Example Implementations
- [ ] 7.1 Create Spring Boot Lambda handler examples with dependency injection
- [ ] 7.2 Add feature flag example using Spring Boot conditional beans
- [ ] 7.3 Create sample AppConfig configurations with Spring Boot property mapping
- [ ] 7.4 Add Spring Boot actuator endpoints for development insights
- [ ] 7.5 Create development vs production Spring profiles
- [ ] 7.6 Add Spring Boot testing utilities for feature flags and Lambda handlers

## 8. Testing and Validation
- [ ] 8.1 Add unit tests for AppConfig client library
- [ ] 8.2 Add integration tests for feature flag functionality
- [ ] 8.3 Test hot deployment workflow with various file change scenarios
- [ ] 8.4 Validate live debugging setup works with ephemeral environments
- [ ] 8.5 Test ephemeral environment isolation and cleanup mechanisms

## 9. Documentation and Guides
- [ ] 9.1 Create EPHEMERAL_DEVELOPMENT.md with comprehensive workflow guide
- [ ] 9.2 Add feature flag usage documentation with examples
- [ ] 9.3 Create live debugging setup guide for different IDEs
- [ ] 9.4 Add troubleshooting section for ephemeral environment and debugging issues
- [ ] 9.5 Update main README.md with new ephemeral development capabilities

## 10. CI/CD Integration
- [ ] 10.1 Add AppConfig deployment to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] 10.2 Create environment-specific feature flag configurations
- [ ] 10.3 Add validation for feature flag schema in CI pipeline
- [ ] 10.4 Test that ephemeral development mode doesn't affect production builds
- [ ] 10.5 Add ephemeral environment cleanup in CI pipeline for PR closure

## Dependencies and Parallelization

### Can be done in parallel:
- Tasks 1-3 (Ephemeral Foundation, Hot Deployment, AppConfig Infrastructure)
- Tasks 7-8 (Examples and Testing) after Tasks 4-5 complete

### Sequential dependencies:
- Task 4 requires Task 3 (AppConfig infrastructure)
- Task 5 requires Task 1 (Ephemeral environment foundation)
- Task 6 requires Tasks 2, 4, 5 (all core functionality)
- Task 9 requires all implementation tasks complete
- Task 10 requires Tasks 3, 4 (AppConfig components)

### Critical path:
1. Ephemeral Environment Foundation (Task 1)
2. AppConfig Infrastructure (Task 3) 
3. Feature Flag Client (Task 4)
4. Hot Deployment Implementation (Task 2)
5. Task Workflow Integration (Task 6)
6. Documentation (Task 9)
