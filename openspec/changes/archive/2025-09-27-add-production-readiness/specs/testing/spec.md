## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Code Coverage Enforcement
The system SHALL enforce 80% minimum code coverage for all Lambda functions using JaCoCo.

#### Scenario: Coverage threshold validation
- **WHEN** code coverage is below 80%
- **THEN** the build SHALL fail with coverage report
- **AND** deployment SHALL be blocked

#### Scenario: Coverage reporting
- **WHEN** tests are executed
- **THEN** detailed coverage reports SHALL be generated
- **AND** coverage metrics SHALL be published to CI/CD pipeline

### Requirement: Unit Testing Framework
The system SHALL provide comprehensive unit tests for all Lambda handler functions and business logic.

#### Scenario: Lambda handler testing
- **WHEN** a Lambda handler is invoked with test event
- **THEN** the response SHALL match expected format
- **AND** all code paths SHALL be tested
- **AND** mock dependencies SHALL verify interactions

#### Scenario: Business logic testing
- **WHEN** business logic methods are invoked
- **THEN** all return values and side effects SHALL be validated
- **AND** edge cases and error conditions SHALL be covered

### Requirement: Integration Testing with LocalStack
The system SHALL provide integration tests using LocalStack for AWS service interactions.

#### Scenario: DynamoDB integration testing
- **WHEN** Lambda function writes to DynamoDB
- **THEN** test SHALL verify data persistence in LocalStack DynamoDB
- **AND** query operations SHALL return expected results

#### Scenario: EventBridge integration testing
- **WHEN** Lambda function publishes events to EventBridge
- **THEN** test SHALL verify event structure and delivery
- **AND** downstream event processing SHALL be validated

### Requirement: Contract Testing for API Gateway
The system SHALL implement contract testing to ensure API compatibility and OpenAPI specification adherence.

#### Scenario: OpenAPI contract validation
- **WHEN** API Gateway endpoint is called
- **THEN** request and response SHALL conform to OpenAPI specification
- **AND** contract validation SHALL detect schema violations

#### Scenario: Consumer contract testing
- **WHEN** API changes are made
- **THEN** existing consumer contracts SHALL remain valid
- **AND** breaking changes SHALL be identified before deployment

### Requirement: End-to-End Testing with Ephemeral Environments
The system SHALL provide end-to-end testing against live API Gateway endpoints in ephemeral AWS environments.

#### Scenario: Ephemeral environment provisioning
- **WHEN** E2E tests are triggered
- **THEN** isolated AWS environment SHALL be created
- **AND** Lambda functions SHALL be deployed to ephemeral environment
- **AND** API Gateway SHALL be accessible with unique endpoints

#### Scenario: E2E API testing with REST Assured
- **WHEN** E2E tests execute against ephemeral environment
- **THEN** all API endpoints SHALL be tested with real HTTP calls
- **AND** authentication flows SHALL be validated end-to-end
- **AND** data persistence SHALL be verified across services

#### Scenario: Ephemeral environment cleanup
- **WHEN** E2E tests complete
- **THEN** ephemeral AWS resources SHALL be automatically destroyed
- **AND** no orphaned resources SHALL remain
- **AND** cleanup SHALL occur within 30 minutes of test completion
