- **AND** assertions SHALL verify complete user workflows

### Requirement: Code Coverage Quality Gates
The system SHALL enforce 80% code coverage threshold as a quality gate in the CI/CD pipeline.

#### Scenario: Coverage threshold enforcement
- **WHEN** JaCoCo coverage report is generated
- **THEN** coverage percentage SHALL be calculated for each module
- **AND** build SHALL fail if any module has less than 80% coverage

- **WHEN** tests complete in CI/CD
- **THEN** coverage report SHALL be uploaded as build artifact
- **AND** coverage badge SHALL be updated in repository
- **AND** coverage trends SHALL be tracked over time

### Requirement: Ephemeral Environment Lifecycle Management
The system SHALL manage ephemeral AWS environments for testing with automatic creation and destruction.

#### Scenario: Ephemeral environment creation
- **WHEN** E2E testing stage begins
- **THEN** unique ephemeral environment SHALL be created using Terraform
- **AND** environment SHALL use `is_ephemeral=true` flag
- **AND** unique namespace SHALL be generated for resource isolation

#### Scenario: Environment variable configuration
- **WHEN** ephemeral environment is created
- **THEN** API Gateway endpoint URL SHALL be captured
- **AND** environment variables SHALL be passed to E2E tests
- **AND** test configuration SHALL use ephemeral resource identifiers

#### Scenario: Manual environment destruction
- **WHEN** testing is complete
- **THEN** user SHALL run `terraform destroy` to clean up resources
- **AND** all ephemeral AWS resources SHALL be removed
- **AND** no orphaned resources SHALL remain in AWS account

### Requirement: Pipeline Stage Orchestration
The system SHALL orchestrate testing stages with proper dependencies and parallel execution where possible.

#### Scenario: Sequential testing stages
- **WHEN** CI/CD pipeline executes
- **THEN** stages SHALL execute in order: Unit → Integration → Contract → Deploy Ephemeral → E2E → Manual Cleanup
- **AND** each stage SHALL depend on successful completion of previous stage
- **AND** pipeline SHALL stop immediately on any stage failure

#### Scenario: Parallel execution optimization
- **WHEN** independent operations can run in parallel
- **THEN** unit tests SHALL run in parallel across modules
- **AND** linting and static analysis SHALL run parallel to testing
- **AND** artifact uploads SHALL run parallel to report generation

#### Scenario: Fast failure and feedback
- **WHEN** any quality gate fails
- **THEN** pipeline SHALL fail immediately with clear error message
- **AND** subsequent stages SHALL be skipped
- **AND** developer feedback SHALL be provided within 10 minutes

### Requirement: Artifact Management and Versioning
The system SHALL properly manage build artifacts with versioning and metadata for deployment traceability.

#### Scenario: ZIP artifact versioning
- **WHEN** Lambda ZIP packages are created
- **THEN** ZIP files SHALL include version information in bootstrap script
- **AND** artifacts SHALL be tagged with commit SHA and build timestamp
- **AND** native binary metadata SHALL include GraalVM version and compilation flags

#### Scenario: Artifact upload and retention
- **WHEN** native build completes successfully
- **THEN** ZIP packages SHALL be uploaded to CI/CD artifact storage
- **AND** artifacts SHALL be retained for 30 days
