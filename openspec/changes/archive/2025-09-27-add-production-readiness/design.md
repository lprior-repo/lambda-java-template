## Context
The Lambda Java template needs production-ready enhancements spanning testing, monitoring, CI/CD, and security. This is a comprehensive change affecting multiple systems and introducing new architectural patterns for enterprise-grade serverless applications.

## Goals / Non-Goals
**Goals:**
- Achieve 80% code coverage with comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Implement enterprise-grade monitoring with CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
- Fix and enhance CI/CD pipeline with security gates and automated deployment
- Establish structured logging framework integrated with CloudWatch
- Enable X-Ray distributed tracing for end-to-end observability

**Non-Goals:**
- Custom monitoring solutions outside AWS ecosystem
- Blue/green deployment strategies (future enhancement)
- Multi-region deployment configuration

## Decisions

### Testing Strategy
- **JaCoCo for Coverage**: Maven plugin with 80% line coverage threshold, build fails below threshold
- **Contract Testing**: Pact or OpenAPI-based contract testing to ensure API compatibility
- **Ephemeral Environments**: Dynamic AWS environments per PR/branch for isolated e2e testing
- **REST Assured for E2E**: Test deployed API Gateway endpoints in ephemeral environments
- **LocalStack for Integration**: Local AWS services simulation for DynamoDB/EventBridge testing
- **TestContainers**: Consistent test environment with Docker containers
- **Quality Gates**: CI/CD blocks deployment if coverage, tests, or contracts fail

### Logging Framework
- **AWS Lambda Powertools Logger**: Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- **CloudWatch Integration**: Native integration with log groups and filtering
- **Log Levels**: DEBUG (local), INFO (production), ERROR/WARN for alerts
- **Correlation IDs**: Track requests across Lambda functions and services
- **Cost Optimization**: Configurable retention periods and log level filtering

### Monitoring & Observability
- **CloudWatch Dashboards**: Business metrics, Lambda performance, error rates
- **Custom Metrics**: Using Lambda Powertools metrics for business events
- **X-Ray Enhanced**: Custom segments for DynamoDB calls, external APIs
- **Alarm Strategy**: Error rate >5%, duration >10s, throttle count >0
- **Health Checks**: Lightweight endpoints for load balancer health monitoring

### CI/CD Architecture
- **GraalVM Native Compilation**: Maven builds JAR, then GraalVM native-image creates native binaries
- **ZIP Package Creation**: Native binaries packaged with bootstrap scripts as ZIP files for Lambda deployment
- **Ephemeral Environments**: Terraform creates isolated AWS environments per PR using `is_ephemeral` flag
- **Test Stages**: Unit → Integration → Contract → Native Build → Deploy Ephemeral → E2E → Manual Cleanup
- **Contract Validation**: API schema validation against OpenAPI spec and consumer contracts
- **Artifact Management**: Signed ZIP packages with native binaries and vulnerability scanning
- **Deployment**: Terraform with provided.al2 runtime using ZIP packages, state management, and rollback capabilities

## Risks / Trade-offs
- **Cold Start Impact**: Additional monitoring/logging may increase Lambda cold start time
  - Mitigation: Use Lambda Powertools efficiently, minimize initialization code
- **Cost Increase**: Enhanced monitoring and longer log retention increases CloudWatch costs
  - Mitigation: Implement log filtering and appropriate retention policies
- **Pipeline Complexity**: More gates may slow down deployment velocity
  - Mitigation: Parallel execution where possible, fast-fail on critical issues
- **Ephemeral Environment Costs**: Each PR creates temporary AWS infrastructure
  - Mitigation: Automatic cleanup, resource limits, cost monitoring alerts
- **Contract Testing Complexity**: API schema changes require consumer coordination
  - Mitigation: Backward-compatible changes, consumer contract validation

## Migration Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Enhance testing infrastructure (JaCoCo, unit tests, integration tests)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement monitoring and logging (CloudWatch, Powertools)
3. **Phase 3**: Fix and enhance CI/CD pipeline (security gates, e2e tests)
4. **Phase 4**: Deploy monitoring infrastructure (dashboards, alarms)
5. **Phase 5**: Validate end-to-end with production deployment

**Rollback Strategy**: 
- Maintain current CI/CD workflow as backup during transition
- Feature flags for new monitoring components
- Terraform state backup before infrastructure changes

## Open Questions
- Should we implement custom error handling middleware for Lambda functions?
- What's the preferred strategy for API versioning in the testing framework?
- Should we add chaos engineering testing with AWS Fault Injection Simulator?
- How should we handle sensitive data in logs (PII redaction)?
