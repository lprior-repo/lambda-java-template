## Why
This Lambda Java template needs comprehensive production-ready enhancements to be suitable for enterprise deployment. Currently missing critical components for observability, testing, and reliable CI/CD deployment that are essential for serverless applications at scale.

## What Changes
- **Enhanced Monitoring & Observability**: CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, custom metrics, and comprehensive X-Ray tracing
- **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, contract testing, and 100% code coverage with JaCoCo
- **Production-Ready CI/CD Pipeline**: Fixed build process, security scanning, performance testing, and automated deployment
- **Security & Compliance**: Enhanced OWASP scanning, dependency vulnerabilities, infrastructure security checks
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory tuning, cold start monitoring, and performance benchmarks

## Impact
- Affected specs: monitoring, testing, cicd-pipeline, security
- Affected code: All Lambda functions, Terraform infrastructure, Maven build configuration, GitHub Actions workflow
- **BREAKING**: CI/CD pipeline restructure may require environment variable updates
- **BREAKING**: New CloudWatch alarms may trigger notifications during deployment
