## 1. Additional Lambda Functions
- [x] 1.1 Create order-validation-service Lambda for input validation
- [x] 1.2 Create payment-service Lambda for payment processing simulation
- [x] 1.3 Create inventory-service Lambda for inventory checks
- [x] 1.4 Create notification-service Lambda for customer notifications
- [x] 1.5 Update parent pom.xml to include new modules

## 2. Step Functions State Machine
- [x] 2.1 Create terraform/step-functions.tf with order processing workflow
- [x] 2.2 Define state machine with parallel execution for inventory/payment
