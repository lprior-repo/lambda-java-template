# local-development Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-local-dev-enhancements. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Hot Deployment to Ephemeral Environments
The system SHALL provide automated deployment to live AWS environments for rapid development iteration.

#### Scenario: Code Change Detection and Deployment

- **THEN** automatically trigger rebuild and deployment to ephemeral AWS environment
- **AND** complete build and deployment cycle in under 30 seconds for JVM builds

#### Scenario: File Watching Configuration
- **WHEN** hot deployment mode is enabled
- **THEN** monitor file patterns: *.java, *.xml, *.properties, *.yaml, *.json
- **AND** exclude build artifacts and IDE files from watching
- **AND** implement debouncing to prevent excessive deployments on multiple rapid changes

#### Scenario: Ephemeral Environment Management
- **WHEN** starting development session
- **THEN** create or reuse ephemeral AWS environment with unique namespace
- **AND** deploy Lambda functions with JVM runtime for faster build times
- **AND** automatically clean up environment when development session ends or on timeout

### Requirement: AWS AppConfig Feature Flag Integration
The system SHALL provide runtime feature flag management using AWS AppConfig.

#### Scenario: Feature Flag Retrieval
- **WHEN** Lambda function initializes
- **THEN** connect to AWS AppConfig and retrieve feature flag configuration
- **AND** cache configuration locally with 30-second TTL
- **AND** implement graceful fallback when AppConfig is unavailable

#### Scenario: Dynamic Feature Flag Updates
- **WHEN** feature flags are updated in AWS AppConfig
- **THEN** Lambda functions detect changes within polling interval
- **AND** apply new feature flag values without requiring redeployment
- **AND** log feature flag changes for audit and debugging

#### Scenario: Local Development Override
- **WHEN** running in local development mode
- **THEN** support local feature flag overrides via environment variables or configuration files
- **AND** clearly indicate when local overrides are active
- **AND** provide easy reset to AppConfig values

### Requirement: Live AWS Lambda Debugging
The system SHALL support remote debugging of Lambda functions running in live AWS environments.

#### Scenario: Remote Debug Session Setup
- **WHEN** starting debug mode for live AWS Lambda
- **THEN** deploy Lambda function with debugging agent and exposed debug port via Lambda Extensions
- **AND** establish secure tunnel connection from IDE to Lambda debug port
- **AND** support breakpoint debugging against live AWS environment

#### Scenario: Debug-Enabled Lambda Deployment
- **WHEN** deploying for debugging
- **THEN** include debugging agent as Lambda layer
- **AND** configure environment variables for debug mode activation
- **AND** extend Lambda timeout to accommodate debugging sessions

#### Scenario: IDE Integration for Remote Debugging
- **WHEN** connecting IDE to live Lambda function
- **THEN** provide IDE-specific configuration templates (IntelliJ, VSCode)
- **AND** automatically configure remote debugging connection settings
- **AND** support step-through debugging of live requests against real AWS services

### Requirement: Ephemeral Environment Management
The system SHALL enable efficient creation and management of temporary AWS environments for development.

#### Scenario: Environment Lifecycle Management
- **WHEN** starting development work
- **THEN** create ephemeral AWS environment with unique namespace derived from branch/developer ID
- **AND** deploy all required AWS services (DynamoDB, EventBridge, AppConfig) with ephemeral configuration
- **AND** automatically clean up environment after configurable timeout or manual termination

#### Scenario: Environment Isolation
- **WHEN** multiple developers work simultaneously
- **THEN** ensure complete isolation between ephemeral environments
- **AND** prevent resource name conflicts using developer-specific prefixes
- **AND** maintain independent data stores and configurations per environment

#### Scenario: Production Parity Testing
- **WHEN** validating changes before production
- **THEN** provide promotion from JVM development environment to native production testing
- **AND** maintain identical AWS service configurations between environments
- **AND** test against real AWS services with production-like data volumes

### Requirement: Developer Workflow Automation
The system SHALL provide streamlined Task-based commands for common development patterns.

#### Scenario: Ephemeral Environment Commands
- **WHEN** starting development work
- **THEN** provide `task ephemeral:start` command for creating and deploying to ephemeral environment
- **AND** provide `task ephemeral:debug` command for debugging against live AWS Lambda
- **AND** provide `task ephemeral:destroy` command for cleaning up environments

#### Scenario: Feature Flag Management Commands
- **WHEN** managing feature flags
- **THEN** provide `task flags:deploy` command for deploying feature flag configurations to ephemeral environment
- **AND** provide `task flags:list` command for viewing current feature flag states in live environment
- **AND** provide `task flags:toggle` command for quick feature flag changes in AppConfig

#### Scenario: Live Debugging Workflow Commands
- **WHEN** debugging applications in AWS
- **THEN** provide commands for deploying debug-enabled Lambda functions
- **AND** provide commands for establishing IDE connection to live Lambda
- **AND** provide commands for monitoring debug sessions and log tailing

### Requirement: Spring Boot 3 Native with AOT Compilation
The system SHALL use Spring Boot Native with Ahead-of-Time compilation to eliminate Lambda cold start penalties while providing excellent development experience.

#### Scenario: AOT Native Compilation for Production
- **WHEN** building for production deployment
- **THEN** use Spring Boot Native with GraalVM AOT compilation to create native executables
- **AND** eliminate JVM startup time and reduce Lambda cold start to sub-100ms
- **AND** compile all Spring Boot features and dependencies ahead-of-time, not dynamically

#### Scenario: Development Mode with DevTools
- **WHEN** running in development mode
- **THEN** use Spring Boot 3 with DevTools for hot reload during development
- **AND** provide rapid feedback loops while maintaining native compilation target
- **AND** enable Spring Boot actuator endpoints for development insights

#### Scenario: Native Image Optimization
- **WHEN** creating Lambda deployment artifacts
- **THEN** produce statically compiled native executables optimized for Lambda runtime
- **AND** ensure no dynamic class loading or reflection at runtime
- **AND** achieve fastest possible Lambda cold start performance with AOT compilation
