# Testing Capability

## Overview
Comprehensive testing strategy for AWS Lambda Java applications with 80% code coverage enforcement and multiple testing layers.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Unit Testing
The system SHALL provide comprehensive unit test coverage for all Lambda handlers.

#### Scenario: Handler Testing
- **WHEN** unit tests execute
- **THEN** achieve minimum 80% line and branch coverage
- **AND** test all business logic paths with JUnit 5 and Mockito

#### Scenario: Service Layer Testing
- **WHEN** testing service classes
- **THEN** mock external dependencies (DynamoDB, EventBridge)
- **AND** validate business logic in isolation

### Requirement: Integration Testing
The system SHALL validate integration with AWS services.

#### Scenario: DynamoDB Integration
- **WHEN** integration tests run
- **THEN** use TestContainers for local DynamoDB testing
- **AND** validate CRUD operations and table schemas

#### Scenario: EventBridge Integration
- **WHEN** testing event publishing
- **THEN** verify events are published with correct structure
- **AND** validate event routing and transformation

### Requirement: Contract Testing
The system SHALL validate API contracts against OpenAPI specifications.

#### Scenario: API Contract Validation
- **WHEN** contract tests execute
- **THEN** validate request/response schemas against OpenAPI spec
- **AND** ensure API compatibility using REST Assured

#### Scenario: Schema Validation
- **WHEN** API endpoints are tested
- **THEN** verify JSON request and response formats
- **AND** catch breaking changes early in development

### Requirement: End-to-End Testing
The system SHALL validate complete user workflows.

#### Scenario: API Workflow Testing
- **WHEN** e2e tests run against deployed infrastructure
- **THEN** test complete user journeys from API to database
- **AND** validate cross-service communication

#### Scenario: Performance Testing
- **WHEN** load testing executes
- **THEN** validate response times under expected load
- **AND** ensure Lambda cold start performance is acceptable

### Requirement: Infrastructure Testing
The system SHALL validate infrastructure deployment and configuration.

#### Scenario: Terratest Validation
- **WHEN** infrastructure tests run
- **THEN** validate all AWS resources are properly configured
- **AND** achieve 100% infrastructure test coverage

#### Scenario: Security Testing
- **WHEN** infrastructure is deployed
- **THEN** validate encryption, IAM policies, and network security
- **AND** ensure compliance with security requirements

### Requirement: Code Coverage Enforcement
The system SHALL enforce minimum code coverage thresholds.

#### Scenario: Coverage Threshold
- **WHEN** build process runs
- **THEN** fail build if coverage falls below 80%
- **AND** generate detailed coverage reports with JaCoCo

#### Scenario: Quality Gates
- **WHEN** CI/CD pipeline executes
- **THEN** enforce coverage requirements before deployment
- **AND** provide feedback on coverage gaps

## Implementation Details

### Testing Framework Stack
- **Unit Testing**: JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ
- **Integration Testing**: TestContainers, LocalStack
- **Contract Testing**: REST Assured, OpenAPI validation
- **Infrastructure Testing**: Terratest (Go), AWS SDK
- **Coverage**: JaCoCo with 80% line and branch coverage

```

### Coverage Requirements
- **Line Coverage**: Minimum 80%
- **Branch Coverage**: Minimum 80%
- **Class Coverage**: Minimum 75%
- **Build Enforcement**: Fail on coverage below threshold

### Test Execution
- **Local Development**: `mvn test` for unit and integration tests
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Parallel execution of all test suites
- **Infrastructure**: Automated Terratest validation on deployment
- **Performance**: Load testing in staging environments
