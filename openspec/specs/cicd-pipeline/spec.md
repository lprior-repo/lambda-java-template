# CI/CD Pipeline Capability

## Overview
Production-ready CI/CD pipeline for AWS Lambda Java applications with GraalVM native compilation and comprehensive quality gates.

## Requirements

### Requirement: GraalVM Native Compilation
The system SHALL build native Lambda functions using GraalVM for optimal performance.

#### Scenario: Native Image Build
- **WHEN** CI pipeline executes
- **THEN** compile Java code to native images using GraalVM
- **AND** create ZIP packages with bootstrap scripts for provided.al2 runtime

#### Scenario: Multi-Service Build
- **WHEN** multiple Lambda services are detected
- **THEN** build each service in parallel using matrix strategy
- **AND** optimize build time while maintaining isolation

### Requirement: Quality Gates
The system SHALL enforce comprehensive quality checks before deployment.

#### Scenario: Code Quality Validation
- **WHEN** code is pushed or PR is created
- **THEN** run unit tests, integration tests, and code coverage analysis
- **AND** fail pipeline if quality thresholds are not met

#### Scenario: Security Scanning
- **WHEN** dependencies are updated
- **THEN** run OWASP dependency checks and static analysis
- **AND** prevent deployment of code with high-severity vulnerabilities

#### Scenario: Infrastructure Validation
- **WHEN** Terraform changes are made
- **THEN** validate syntax, formatting, and security with tfsec
- **AND** ensure infrastructure as code best practices

### Requirement: Automated Testing
The system SHALL run comprehensive test suites in CI/CD pipeline.

#### Scenario: Test Execution
- **WHEN** pipeline runs
- **THEN** execute unit tests, integration tests, and contract tests
- **AND** generate coverage reports and test artifacts

#### Scenario: Infrastructure Testing
- **WHEN** deployment occurs
- **THEN** run Terratest validation against deployed infrastructure
- **AND** verify all AWS resources are properly configured

### Requirement: Native Deployment Configuration
The system SHALL support deploying Lambda functions as native images with provided.al2 runtime.

#### Scenario: Native Runtime Selection
- **WHEN** native deployment mode is enabled via environment configuration
- **THEN** use provided.al2 runtime instead of java21
- **AND** deploy native ZIP packages containing bootstrap scripts and native binaries

#### Scenario: Conditional Deployment Mode
- **WHEN** deployment is configured
- **THEN** support both native and JVM deployment modes via toggle
- **AND** maintain backward compatibility with existing JVM deployments

### Requirement: Artifact Management
The system SHALL manage both JVM and native build artifacts with proper versioning.

#### Scenario: Native Package Creation
- **WHEN** native compilation succeeds
- **THEN** create deployment ZIP packages with bootstrap scripts
- **AND** upload artifacts with metadata and retention policies

#### Scenario: Runtime-Specific Artifacts
- **WHEN** Terraform deployment occurs
- **THEN** select appropriate artifact based on runtime configuration
- **AND** ensure correct artifact-to-runtime mapping (native.zip → provided.al2, standard.zip → java21)

#### Scenario: Versioning Strategy
- **WHEN** artifacts are created
- **THEN** tag with commit SHA and build number
- **AND** enable traceability from deployment to source code

### Requirement: Deployment Automation
The system SHALL support automated deployment to multiple environments.

#### Scenario: Environment Promotion
- **WHEN** all quality gates pass
- **THEN** enable automated deployment to development environment
- **AND** support promotion to staging and production

#### Scenario: Rollback Capability
- **WHEN** deployment issues occur
- **THEN** provide ability to rollback to previous version
- **AND** maintain deployment history and audit trail

### Requirement: Performance Optimization
The system SHALL optimize build and deployment performance.

#### Scenario: Parallel Execution
- **WHEN** pipeline runs
- **THEN** execute independent jobs in parallel
- **AND** minimize total pipeline execution time

#### Scenario: Caching Strategy
- **WHEN** dependencies are resolved
- **THEN** cache Maven dependencies and build artifacts
- **AND** reduce build time for subsequent runs

## Implementation Details

### Pipeline Architecture
```yaml
Jobs:
├── detect-changes     # Detect modified services
├── lint              # Code quality checks (parallel)
├── infrastructure    # Terraform validation (parallel)
├── build [matrix]    # Multi-service builds with GraalVM
├── terratest        # Infrastructure testing (conditional)
└── ci-summary       # Pipeline summary and reporting
```

### Build Process
1. **Java Compilation**: Maven package with shade plugin
2. **Native Compilation**: GraalVM native-image with optimizations
3. **ZIP Creation**: Bootstrap script + native binary packaging
4. **Artifact Upload**: Versioned artifacts with metadata

### Quality Gates
- **Unit Tests**: JUnit 5 with 80% coverage requirement
- **Integration Tests**: TestContainers for AWS service testing
- **Security Scans**: OWASP dependency check with CVSS 7+ threshold
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform validate, fmt, and tfsec security scanning

### Native Image Configuration
```bash
native-image \
  --no-fallback \
  --enable-http \
  --enable-https \
  --initialize-at-run-time=org.slf4j,ch.qos.logback \
  --report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime \
  -H:Name=function-native \
  com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.api.client.AWSLambda
```

### Environment Support
- **Development**: Automated deployment on main branch
- **Staging**: Manual promotion with approval gates
- **Production**: Controlled deployment with rollback capability
- **Ephemeral**: Temporary environments for testing

### Performance Metrics
- **Build Time**: Optimized for <2 minutes per service
- **Native Compilation**: ~45 seconds per function
- **Artifact Size**: Native images 50-70% smaller than JVM
- **Cold Start**: 2-3x faster startup with native images
